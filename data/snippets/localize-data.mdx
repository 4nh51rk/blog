summary: Return localized data for a region with Faker
---

Seeding data with Faker, you can specify a locale to return localized data for that region.

[See a list of locale providers here](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker/tree/master/src/Faker/Provider)

`config/app.php`

Now any locale specific data that we create will be created based on our specified region.
```php
public function definition()
{
    return [
        'name' => $this->faker->name,
        'phone' => $this->faker->address,
        'address' => $this->faker->phoneNumber,
    ];
}
```
